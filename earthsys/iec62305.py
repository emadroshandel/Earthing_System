# Behaviour under the impulse — effective length and effective area
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Everything above this line is a power-frequency or d.c. calculation: the
# whole electrode is assumed to be at one potential, so making it longer
# always lowers the resistance.  A lightning current does not behave that
# way.  The front is over in a microsecond or two, and in that time the
# travelling wave has only reached a limited distance along the buried
# conductor; the series inductance of the conductor holds the far end back
# while the leakage conductance to soil is already bleeding the current away
# near the injection point.  Beyond that distance the electrode carries
# almost no current and contributes almost nothing.  That distance is the
# *effective length*, and it is why a 200 m radial electrode is no better
# under lightning than a 30 m one.
#
# Two consequences matter to a designer:
#
#   1. Extra electrode length beyond L_eff is money spent for nothing.
#   2. The earth potential rise under a stroke is larger — often much
#      larger — than I·R would suggest from the resistance measured with a
#      d.c. or 50 Hz tester, because only the effective part is working.
