Explanation of every compliance verdict.

The calculation modules decide whether a criterion passes.  This module says
*why*: what the criterion physically protects against, which quantity drove
the result, by how much it passed or failed, and — when it failed — exactly
which design lever restores compliance and what value that lever needs.

Nothing here changes a result. It only interprets one, so the same numbers can
be taught, defended in a design review, and printed in the report.

Each explanation is a dict:

    meaning   what the criterion means in physical terms
    verdict   the quantified outcome, in one sentence
    driver    the quantity that dominates the result
    remedy    list of concrete actions with their computed effect (failures)
    headroom  how much margin remains (passes)
