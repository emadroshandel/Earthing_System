## Standards

This software implements calculation methods published in IEEE and IEC
standards, and reproduces the numerical constants those methods require
(material properties, tabulated coefficients, limit values), each with a
citation to the clause it comes from.

It does **not** reproduce the text, figures, commentary or tables of any
standard, and it is **not** a substitute for them. Anyone using this software
for real design work must hold and read the applicable standards themselves.
No endorsement by IEEE, IEC, BSI or any other standards body is claimed or
implied.
